                   The idea of this class is to have all the methods nessesary for generating
                an image for the player to see what his sharacter can see.  I will start with
                a 2D senital vew of the maze but at the end if I have enough time I will make
                a 3d one.
            
                   Also create a constructor for making the kind of camera you need.. 
                   you may need more kind of cameras...
            
                   for now the Camera dont need instanses
